# Project Name
Telecom churn case study

## Objective
In the telecom industry, customers are able to choose from multiple service providers and actively switch from one operator to another. In this highly competitive market, the telecommunications industry experiences an average of 15-25% annual churn rate. Given the fact that it costs 5-10 times more to acquire a new customer than to retain an existing one, customer retention has now become even more important than customer acquisition.

For many incumbent operators, retaining high profitable customers is the number one business
goal. To reduce customer churn, telecom companies need to predict which customers are at high risk of churn. In this project, we should analyze customer-level data of a leading telecom firm, build predictive models to identify customers at high risk of churn, and identify the main indicators of churn.
   
The goal is to build a machine learning model that is able to predict churning customers based on the features provided for their usage.

- Identify customers at high risk of churn by building a predicitve ML model
- To Identify important churn predictors
- Improve the overall accuracy of the model, using different models and explain the business objectives
- Recommend different strategies to cointain the churn based on observations from models.

## Approach
Steps followed in solving the Telecom churn case study

<b>Step-0 Understanding problem</b> 

<b>Step-1 Data Understanding (EDA) and visualization:</b> Impute missing value, null value treatment, Univariate and Bivariate analysis, visulaizing the data with appropriate plots

<b>Step-2 Data Preperation and modeling:</b> Class imbalance, dummy variables, and scaling, train test split, build different models like, LR, decision Tree classifier, random forest etc

<b>Step-3 Model Development and Evaluation:</b> identify the important features and best model.

<b>Step-4 Prediction:</b> Predictions on unseen test data
